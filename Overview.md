As humans, we learn from our past experiences and thus could better adjust our performances in the future. 
The first time you have a dinner in a new restaurant, the experience you had in the restaurant would 
influence whether or not you will choose the restaurant again. 
For machines, they are developed and given instructions by humans to help perform some tasks. 
Calculators can be used to help us figure out the square root of an extremely large number. 
For simple tasks like calculating the square root of a number, humans can explicitly program the command. 
However, for advanced tasks, it may be hard for humans to efficiently create the needed algorithms to be put in the machines. 

> ### Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.  

Here is when **machine learning** comes in handy. **Tasks can be performed by machine learning programs without being explicitly programmed to do. 
Machines learn from the data provided** (Wink-wink, we will talk about details of different datasets later in this chapter) and then perform certain tasks. 
**In Bioinformatics**, application of machine learning algorithms include **genomics, proteomics, microarrays, systems biology, evolution, and text 
mining**.
